# AirBnB Seattle
## Udacity writing a Data Science Blog Post

## Project Overview and motivation
This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. The aim of the project is to demostrate knowlege of the CRISP-DM Process for Data Analysis and Data Mining, be able to follow the process and then communicate your findings effectively and clearly to an audience. Using this data, we will try to explore the below questions in terms of pricing and factors affecting pricing in Seattle
1. Monthly Number of listings and their average price/night?
2. What is the average price/night in the neighborhood?
3. Which variables have a strong relationship with the price of listings?

## Python Packeges used
This project is executed in a Jupyter Notebook with the help of below packages

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

## Conclusion
1. There is a correlation between the number of available listings and prices which could be due to demand and supply. As seen, the number of listing in January was highest but the average price was lowest and in July, the average price was highest whereas the number of available listings was lowest.
2. There is a real big difference between Magnolia and surrounding neighborhoods in Seattle, with Magnolia costing ~$200 and the cheapest neighborhood Delridge costing almost half the amount at ~$90$.
3. There are five variables â€” accommodation, bedrooms, beds, guests included, and square feet that have a strong relationship with price.
